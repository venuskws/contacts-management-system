# contacts-management-system

This is the term assignment of our first-semester C programming course. I uploaded this as a demonstration of what I have been able to achieve through my study program.
A contacts management system allows for the CRUD operations on a list of contacts.

a2ms4.c was provided by the professors to test our code.

Honesty declaration: The reason that I did not use the original git repository from the course is because I do not want this to be found by students who would potentially copy my solution. As Iâ€™m still also a student, this could impact me as well. If you are a fellow student, please do not copy my code in your assignment. You are welcome to contact me for help instead.
